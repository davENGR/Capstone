#Within the /boot/config.txt file of the Raspberry Pi, edit it in such a way that you will be able to hard force the Pi
#to output between HDMI and composite

#hdmi_force_hotplug=1

#the above statement should be left commented out, because what it does is it will set the visual output to HDMI even if no HDMI 
#monitor is detected

#in the case that you are wanting to use just HDMI outputs, then the config.txt will not need to be adjusted, and equally so
#with RCA, you should not need to adjust it, but to allow for both to be connected and detected, but want to force the RCA, add 
#the following

hdmi_ignore_hotplug=1

#if need to look further into ways to possibly doing about this, look at the following reference:
#www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt.md
