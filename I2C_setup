#The following is not my own work, but a comparitive understanding of two tutorials from the following sites:
#https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
#http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-I2C-Python/

#there are a few things you need to do, and not in any particular order, to get the i2c enabled and ready to use

#(1 of 4) Install the i2c-tools utility
  #Within cmd, type the following
  
  sudo apt-get install python-mbus
  sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
  
  #I am having download issues thus far in trying to get the i2c-tools to install, and none of the forums so far are shedding 
  #light on how to resolve this
  
#(2 of 4) Enable i2c (depending on your distribution, you may not need to do this step) 
  #verify within your distribution if you have or not the file /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf, by typing in cmd
  ls /etc/modprobe.d/
  
  #more than likely, the files exists, though is blank, which you can still ignore it, but if you want to play it safe, edit it
  
  #blacklist spi-bcm2708
  #blacklist i2c-bcm2708
  
  #in effect, you just need to comment out the blacklist statments
  #once you are done editing the file, save your changes using
  Control+X, then Y, then RETURN
  
#(3 of 4) Modify the /boot/config.txt file 
  #If you are using a recent Raspberry Pi (3.18 kernel >) then update the config file
  sudo nano /boot/config.txt
  
  #add the following at the end of the file
  dtparam=i2c1=on
  dtparam=i2c_arm=on
  
#(4 of 4) modify the /etc/modules files
  #update the file similarly in step 3 using the instruction
  sudo nano /etc/modules
  
  #add the following at the end of the file
  i2c-bcm2708
  i2c-dev
  
#After doing the above instructions, make sure to reboot your system for the changes to take affect
  sudo reboot
  
#to run a quick test to verify that you have set it up correctly run the following
  sudo i2cdetect -y 1
